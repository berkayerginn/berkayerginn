# üí´ About Me:
 I recently graduated from Bartƒ±n University with a degree in Computer Engineering. I completed my internship at<br> TeamPro Teknoloji successfully. Throughout my academic career, I participated as a speaker in all seminars organized<br> by our university and represented our institution at events hosted by other universities. I engaged in various projects,<br> applying the theoretical knowledge I acquired in practice. I developed a quadcopter for the project titled "Design and<br> Development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Logistics Purposes," approved by T√úBƒ∞TAK 2209-B. This project was<br> successfully presented at the Bartƒ±n University R&D Center and was recognized for its achievements. To further my<br> development, I received training from TUSA≈û TEI School of Aviation Engines. I also enhanced my skills through English<br> language training at Navras Academy and C# programming training. As a team leader, I was involved in various tasks<br> and projects with the Cybersecurity Club, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Club, and Aviation and Space Club. With a strong<br> ability in active listening and high empathy, I am highly motivated to apply the knowledge gained during my education<br> to my professional career.
